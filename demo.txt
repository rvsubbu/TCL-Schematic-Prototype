Self Intro
	EDA veteran - FrontLine, Synplicity
					Simulation, Synthesis, Floorplanning, FPGA
	GUI veteran - vt220 terminal. X Windows Microsoft Windows, MFC
	Software veteran - C/C++ Data Structures, Algorithms
	Fast learner - production level quality code in almost all scripting languages
					Web/javascript, phonegap, mobile etc.

	TCL - used TCL as the usual EDA glue language
	TK - no real experience, helloworld level

Prototype:
	Vineet's call
	First iteration of requirements understanding - TK internals
	Second iteration - TK for EDA
	TCL-Schematic-Prototype
	Prototype for Synopsys TCL/TK GUI Position
	Schematic viewer for Vineet Rashingkar
	version 0.2
	RV
	Start Date: Nov4, 2013
	Deadline: Nov7, 2013
	Actual Finish: Nov8, 2013
	Language: TCL/TK

	What does the prototype do:
		Create netlist - insts, nets and regions using newly defined TCL "commands"
		Advantage - just use tcl syntax without having to learn a complete new language (some new commands)

		All insts have geometry (x,y,wid,hei)
		Specify numIns and numOuts
		Displayed as rects
		
		Nets have a from and to.
		nets shown as flylines

		regions have a geometry
		Displayed as dotted rects

		General philosophy: Everything can be executed as a command. Some of
		the commands have a menu option, a key binding etc.

		Assign inst to region

Netlist commands:
	nlInst name <-type type> <-numInputs numInputs> <-numOutputs numOutputs> <-parent parentInst> <-x x> <-y y> <-width width> <-height height> <-region region>
	nlNet <-name name> -from fromPort -to toPort
	nlRegion <-x x> <-y y> <-width width> <-height height>

GUI commands:
	loadDesign fileName
	saveDesign fileName
	clearDesign
	designInfo
	selectInst instName
	unselectInst
	instInfo instName
	showInstConnections
	selectRegion rgnName
	unselectRegion
	regionInfo rgnName
	selectNet netName
	unselectNet
	netInfo
	setPinDisplay
	goIntoRegion
	nlSetChipWidth
	nlSetChipHeight
	regionFlylines
	assignInstToRegion
	showRegionConnections
	showNetConnections

This is just a prototype
	Lots of pending issues to be addressed
	Testing (laptop issue)
	Tooltip bug
	More realistic pictures (mux, FF, gates etc.)
	region analysis
		how many nets go out of a region? how many nets between rgn1 & rgn2?
	Define rest of the chip as a region
	descend into an inst
	display pin names
	popup menu for rgn/inst/nets
	Dialog to set parameters like net color, inst color, and so on
	Not much error checking
	No performance profiling (laptop issue, some flashing)
